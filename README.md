#### **April, 2025** 
#### [**By Mr. Jefferson Mwatati**](https://github.com/jeffersonmwatati)
Combining my interest in **Finance** and **Investment** with my **Tech skills**, Iâ€™m developing an **Forex trading tool** using **Python**. The **algorithm** will integrate **technical indicators** and **news analytics** to deliver smart, automated **trading strategies** for improved **decision-making** and **risk management**.

***Note: No code will be shared here, only documentation, experience, screenshots, steps taken on the journey to build the Algorithm***

## Target 1: Develop an Algorithm to Log in to Broker Account on MetaTrader 5
This objective focuses on establishing a secure and reliable connection to your MetaTrader 5 (MT5) trading account through the use of Python. The following steps are involved:
   1. **Initialize MT5 Connection:** Specify the explicit path to the MetaTrader 5 terminal on your local system.
   2. **Login to MT5 Account:** Authenticate using your trading account credentials.
   3. **Set Broker Details:** Define the broker's server name to ensure the terminal connects to the correct trading environment.

**Results**
